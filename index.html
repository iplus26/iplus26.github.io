				<h1>About Me</h1></h1>
				<p>Front end developer, an undergraduate of UESTC (short for University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, I still can't spell its English full name), living in Chengdu right now. </p>
				<p>I am developer of <a target="_blank" href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/zh-cn/app/7eddcdbc-35a4-47ef-8ea7-fe7c37152d41">Watched</a>, a Windows 8.1 app for Douban Movie (Chinese version IMDb), 
					and the author of doumail-back, a Safari extension (which gains me most stars on GitHub, and honestly I don't want them... on such a repository).
				</p>
					
				<p>I spend major of my time on <a href="#front-end-dev">front end development</a> now,
					but I am also able and willing to do some <a href="#back-end-dev">back end development</a> and other works.
				</p>

				<p>I write JavaScript since this February. JavaScript is a powerful tool that easily make my ideas come true. 
				   I started from a simple Safari extension, <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/iplus26/dbmovie">dbmovie</a>, 
				   which shows IMDb ratings and more in Douban Movie page. There were several implements for Chrome or Firefox, but no Safari version.
				</p>
				<p>
					Then I made <a target="_blank" href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/zh-cn/app/7eddcdbc-35a4-47ef-8ea7-fe7c37152d41">Watched</a>, a Windows 8.1 app for Douban Movie.
					I like the Modern UI design, and Douban Movie. Kill two birds with one stone!
					<a target="_blank" href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/zh-cn/app/7eddcdbc-35a4-47ef-8ea7-fe7c37152d41">Watched</a>
					once ranked #2 in Windows Store New Rising Apps, and I was so excited, and then I never update it...
				</p>
				<p>
					CSS is also amazing. I used to dream to be an artist one day. 
					With CSS, I can do a huge number of things that I couldn't do with nearly no PS skills. 
					I am very interested in different implements using CSS right now.

				<p>
					I wrote PHP for a while. <a href="http://watched.sinaapp.com/" target="_blank">Watched</a>,
				    which makes me familiar with the API <del>and the hacks</del> of Douban Movie, is my very first project and the last.
				    Steve Jobs said that, 
				</p>
				    <blockquote>
						You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.
					</blockquote>
			    <p>
					The point is that this project helps a lot when I was making the Windows 8.1 app.
				</p>
			
				<h2 id="else-skills">Else</h2>
				<p>Besides development, I am also interested in design and products. 
				   I love movies, so you may have noticed that many of my stuffs is about movies. 
				   I am a huge fan of Apple, and planning to head for iOS/OS X development later this year.
